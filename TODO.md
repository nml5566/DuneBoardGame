Refactor canvas container to use static zIndexes
================================================
Layers (from top to bottom):
* notification (temporary and should be removed/hidden after use)
* territory image map (the image map div that lets users select territories)
* troop tokens (shows where factions are on the map)
* player seats (player positions on the board that determine turn order)
* storm token
* map background image

Initial Troop Deployment
